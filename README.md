# Line-Follower-Bot-
Line Follower Bot

This program runs on Arduino Uno with 4 IR sensors.
Sensor.cpp will check if sensor is working and shows the read

Control_PID uses PID controler to control
White.cpp takes all 4 sensors on white as straight line
Black.cpp supposes when the 2 sensors in the middle is black as a straight line

All these 3 are possible to run a line follower bot

I know perhaps some of you are too busy to take bath.
But please force yourself to take bath everyday for other's benefit.
